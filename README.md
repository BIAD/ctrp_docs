# ctrp_docs
The CTRP user documentation is in the wiki (https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/CTRPdoc). 

This repository is currently only being used to contain copies of files (the XSD files and the Accrual Batch File Tool spreadsheet), so that the wiki can link to them. These copies are all in the Shared folder of the ctrp-docs repo. The wiki label https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/label/github-links indicates which pages have links to these copies.

The OnlineHelp folder in this repo contains files from an experiment with RoboHelp.
